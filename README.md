# Guam-Coconut-Rhinoceros-Beetle-Trap-Data-as-a-Flat-File

A high school student requested Guam coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) trap data to explore as a project for a math class. 

CRB trap data are saved in a couple of tables in an online MySQL database.

The [Jupyter Notebook in this project](https://github.com/aubreymoore/Guam-Coconut-Rhinoceros-Beetle-Trap-Data-as-a-Flat-File/blob/master/Guam%20CRB%20Trap%20Data%20as%20a%20Flat%20File.ipynb) shows how I used Python to combine data from the two tables into a flat file which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/aubreymoore/Guam-Coconut-Rhinoceros-Beetle-Trap-Data-as-a-Flat-File/raw/master/trap_data.csv).  The flat file is in CSV (comma-separated values) format which can be opened by most spreadsheet programs.
